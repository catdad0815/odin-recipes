        <h2>Description</h2>
        This raspberry lemonade is a riff on the 
        fresh-squeezed lemonade I used to love to drink 
        when visiting amusement parks during childhood 
        summers.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups fresh squeezed lemon juice
                from 8-12 lemons, strained</li>
            <li>1/2 pound (8oz.) raspberries, plus more
                for serving</li>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
            <li>Fresh mint, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the raspberries and 1/2 cup of 
                lemon juice in a blender</li>
            <li>Puree until smooth</li>
            <li>Pass mixture through a sieve into a large bowl
                to strain out seeds (the fastest way to force it
                through is by pressing a ladle against the strainer
                in a circular motion).</li>
        </ol>
