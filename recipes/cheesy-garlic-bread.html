        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf french bread</li>
            <li>1/2 butter <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley <em>divided</em></li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
            <li>1 cup fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 fresh grated sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice french bread in half lengthwise. 
                Place, each half, cut side up, on a foil
                lined baking sheet</li>
            <li>Stir together softened butter, minced
                garlic, and 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley.
                Spread evenly on each half of the french bread loaf.
                In a small bowl combine cheese then sprinkly evenly
                on top of the bread. Sprinkle remaining parsley evenly
                over the cheeses.</li>
                <li>Bake in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes. Turn on
                    the broiler to high, move the rack position, and broiler
                    for the last 2-3 minutes until cheese is golden and
                    bubbly. (*The broiler step is optional-you could just let
                    it bake for the 10 minutes).
                </li>
        </ol>
